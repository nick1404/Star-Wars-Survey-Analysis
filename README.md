# Star-Wars-Survey-Analysis

In this project, we will analyse survey responses about the Star Wars movie franchise. I am a huge fan of the franchise and want to find out which Star Wars movies are most viewed and best-ranked by the survey respondents. The analysis will also include:
- seeing whether the "original" Star Wars movies (Episode IV, V and VI) are more liked than the newer ones (Episode I, II and III);
- investigating whether IMDB ratings correlate with the ratings of the survey respondents;
- exploring the differences in responses between male and female genders;
- investigating the correlation between whether a respondent considers themselves to be a fan of the franchise and the movie ratings.

The main dataset used for analysis (**star_wars.csv**) consists of a survey that was done by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/). Additional information (**imdb.csv**) was collected from [IMDB](IMDB.com).
